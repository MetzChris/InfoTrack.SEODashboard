# InfoTrack.SEODashboard
A web project containing a Dashboard that provides search results ranking a given url and keyword.

**Thank you for considering me!**

## Summary ##

- I've included all of the required elements described in the documentation including using C#, .NET Core, a Javascript framework (ReactJS), Unit Tests, Javascript/UI tests,
and some overengineered UI elements, as well as an integration with GoogleAPI to return search results.

- Let me know if you have any questions or issues compiling, running, or understanding what I've done.

*npm run test    - Should run the several UI Unit tests I've created*
